# Card Slide Concept

A proof of concept of a mechanic implemented in ruby where cards slide to separate whenever they are placed overlapping.

Many optimizations can still be made so the performance could be improved:

1. Implement a grid or a quadtree for collision checking.
2. Smarter reuse of objects so that less garbage collection needs to occur.
3. More efficient C to Ruby bindings.
